## Summary 
Based on the data, the most profitable segment would be subscribers.  The focus of any program created in Des Moines should revolve around attracting those individuals who would become annual subscribers.  

For additional analysis, the data indicated there were peak hours of ridership during the daily commute.  More analysis should be done to determine as to whether the city of Des Moine has similar commute schedules.  Also, using a motor vehicle can challenging in New York City, due to the highly concentrated population.  More analysis should also be done related to population density and the availability of parking.
